# Git-Flow Commands

Git Flow commands are commands used in a `git flow` ie:

* to add, prepare, undo commits
* create and merge branches

## How the git flow command works together?

* Create a feature branch

```bash
git-branch my-feature
# with alias
gb my-feature
```

* Makes changes (modification, deletion)
* Check your changes

```bash
git status
# with alias
gs
```

* Check the added or modified files against `git hooks` with `pre-commit` (missing link, styling, ...)

```bash
git-prepare
# with alias
gp
```

* Bad modification happens. Get in a clean state as a `git clone`

```bash
git-reset
# with alias
gr
```

* Commit or amend (ie recreate the last commit with your modified files)

```bash
##########
# commit
##########
git-commit "optional commit message"
# or with alias
gc "optional commit message"

##########
# amend
##########
git-amend # amend the last commit with the last commit message
# or with alias
ga "optional new commit message"
```

* Check your last commit

```bash
git-log
# with alias
gl
```

* Check all your commits on the feature branch

```bash
git-feature-log
# with alias
gfl
```

* Integrate the commits from the main branch

```bash
git-feature-rebase
# with alias
gfr
```

* Squash all commits on the feature branch to one (before merge if wanted)

```bash
git-feature-squash
# with alias
gfs
```

* Merge your feature branch into `main`

```bash
git-feature-merge
# with alias
gfm
```

* Delete a tag and the GitHub release

```bash
git-tag-delete
# with alias
gtd
```

## Common rules

Common rules applied by all commands

| No need to                 | Why?                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| pass arguments             | We recreate the official git commands without arguments by default                                                                                                       |
| sync                       | Local and remote repo are synced immediately <br/> The commands suppose that you are working alone on a `feature` branch so that they can delete a remote commit safely. |
| add files                  | All files found in the index go to the next commit (ie not staged files are automatically staged)                                                                        |
| execute them on submodules | If your repository has sub-modules, the commands are also performed on them. See the [submodules page](submodule.md) for actual support by command                       |

The `2 letters alias` column in the below list is a proposed alias that you can create in your `.bashrc`. Example:

```bash
alias ga='git-amend'
```
